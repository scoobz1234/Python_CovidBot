# Python_CovidBot

This is a Graphical User Interface created and implemented with my
Covid-19 Bot. This bot is contextual (new from the last version)
Meaning it can retain the context of the conversation you are having
within reason of course! The bot will train every time you run the program
This is happening because its really fast, and it can be afforded.

## Getting Started

Make sure you utilize the packages in requirements.txt to ensure you have the correct environment setup.
run main.py

### Prerequisites

I recommend using Anaconda and python 3.6 and make sure you create the environment in conda

```
conda create -y --name NAMEOFENVIRONMENT python==3.6
```

### Installing

Installing is pretty straight forward, Open anaconda prompt and type the following

```
conda install -f -y -q --name NAMEOFENVIRONMENT -c conda-forge --file requirements.txt
conda activate NAMEOFENVIRONMENT
```

And then

```
python main.py
```
